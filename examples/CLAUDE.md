# examples/ — Example Sprites

Sample sprite directories demonstrating the GridFab file format.

## Contents

- **`quern/`** — A 32x32 quern (hand mill) sprite with 5 colors. Includes grid.txt, palette.txt, and pre-rendered PNGs at multiple scales.

## Purpose

These examples serve as:
1. Quick visual demos of what GridFab produces
2. Test fixtures for manual verification
3. Reference for the file format

## Note

Generated PNG files in examples are tracked in git (unlike the rest of the project) so users can see outputs without running the tool.
